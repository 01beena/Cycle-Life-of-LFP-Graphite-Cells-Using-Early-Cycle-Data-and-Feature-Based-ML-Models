### Predicting Cycle Life of LFP/Graphite Cells Using Early-Cycle Data and Feature-Based ML Models


In this study, a data-driven approach is employed to accurately predict the cycle life of commercial lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite cells using early-cycle data without prior knowledge of degradation mechanisms. The early-prediction model is constructed using a feature-based approach, where features such as initial discharge capacity, charge time, and cell can temperature are generated and utilized within a regularized linear framework. These features are proposed based on domain knowledge of lithium-ion batteries.

Several features are derived from the discharge voltage curve to capture the electrochemical evolution of individual cells during cycling. For the Q(V) discharge voltage curves of each cell, summary statistics including minimum, mean, and variance are calculated. The change in voltage curves between two cycles is captured by each summary statistic. Three alternative models have been explored due to the significant predictive potential of features based on Q100-10(V): (1) variance of ΔQ100-10(V), (2) additional candidate features obtained during discharge, and (3) features from supplementary data streams such as temperature and internal resistance. Data collection spans the first 100 cycles in every case.

These three models aim to assess the cost-benefit of collecting more data streams and the accuracy limits of prediction. The training data, consisting of 41 cells, is used to select model features and coefficient values, while the primary testing data, comprising 43 cells, evaluates model performance. Additionally, the model is validated using a secondary testing dataset of 40 cells, generated after model development. Prediction performance is quantified using two metrics: root-mean-square error (RMSE), measured in cycles, and average percentage error, detailed in the ‘Machine-Learning Model Creation’ section.

Data separation into training and test sets is followed by the application of the elastic net for training, resulting in a linear model with downselected features and coefficients. The model is subsequently applied to both primary and secondary test sets. Elastic net prediction and data processing are conducted in MATLAB, while classification is performed in Python using NumPy, pandas, and sklearn libraries.
